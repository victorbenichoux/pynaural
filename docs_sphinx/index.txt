.. Spatializer documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. [How it works] One always needs the toctree thing. The names are actually filenames (with folders but no extension). 

Welcome to Spatializer's documentation!
